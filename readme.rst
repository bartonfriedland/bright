Bright is an attempt to rewrite a fast fuel cycle components using C++, SQL databases for libraries, and one group cross-section data for the reactor.

Bright is specifically designed to be plugged into Python code (CPython Objects) and, hopefully, GENIUS, the University of Wisc code.

The C++ code may be found in the FCComps directory.  

The Python version, including a handy setup.py file may be found under BriPy.
