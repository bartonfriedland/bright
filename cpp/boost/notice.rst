NOTICE!
=======
The code in this sub-directory is from the Boost C++ project.
It is included here because I am too lazy to write my own 
Bessel functions, so I have poached them from another library.

However, this means that everything in this directory and below
is subject to the Boost license (included here).

To keep in line with the most recent versions of Boost, I 
have an included a python script that will grab the 
appropriate files.  

Note that the entire Boost library is not included here.
Instead it only grabs the restricted sub-set that bright needs.
